- To architect a modern ML system for real-time personalized recommenders.
- To do feature engineering using modern tools such as Polars.
- To design and train ML models for recommender systems powered by neural networks.
- To use MLOps best practices by leveraging [Hopsworks AI Lakehouse](https://rebrand.ly/homepage-github).

## 📖 About This Course

This course is part of Decoding ML's open-source series, where we provide free hands-on resources for building GenAI and recommender systems.

The **Hands-on H&M Real-Time Personalized Recommender**, in collaboration with [Hopsworks](https://rebrand.ly/homepage-github), is a 5-module course backed up by code, Notebooks and lessons that will teach you how to build an H&M real-time personalized recommender from scratch.

By the end of this course, you will know how to architect, build and deploy a modern recommender.

**What you'll do:**

1. Architect a scalable and modular ML system using the Feature/Training/Inference (FTI) architecture.
3. Feature engineering on top of our H&M data for collaborative and content-based filtering techniques for recommenders.
2. Use the two-tower network to Create user and item embeddings in the same vector space.
3. Implement an H&M real-time personalized recommender using the 4-stage recommender design and a vector database.
4. Use MLOps best practices, such as a feature store and a model registry.
5. Deploy the online inference pipeline to Kubernetes using KServe.
6. Deploy the offline ML pipelines to GitHub Actions.
7. Implement a web interface using Streamlit.
8. Improve the H&M real-time personalized recommender using LLMs.

🥷 With these skills, you'll become a ninja in building real-time personalized recommenders. 

## 🌐 Live Demo

Try out our deployed H&M real-time personalized recommender to see what you'll learn to build by the end of this course:
[💻 Live H&M Recommender Streamlit Demo](https://decodingml-hands-on-personalized-recommender.streamlit.app/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo is in 0-cost mode, which means that when there is no traffic, the deployment scales to 0 instances. The first time you interact with it, give it 1-2 minutes to warm up to 1+ instances. Afterward, everything will become smoother.

## 👥 Who Should Join?

**This course is ideal for:**
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready recommender systems
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind recommenders

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than theoretical model optimization or research.

## 🎓 Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Skills** | Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning |
| **Hardware** | Any modern laptop/workstation will do the job (no GPU or powerful computing power required). We also support Google Colab or GitHub Actions for compute.|
| **Level** | Intermediate |


## 💰 Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except OpenAI's API, as follows:

- Modules 1-4: Completely free
- Module 5 (Optional): ~$1-2 for OpenAI API usage when building LLM-enhanced recommenders

## 🥂 Open-source Course: Participation is Open and Free

As an open-source course, you don't have to enroll. Everything is self-paced, free of charge and with its resources freely accessible as follows:
- **code**: this GitHub repository
- **articles**: [Decoding ML](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-recommender-system-framework)

## 📚 Course Outline

This **open-source course consists of 5 comprehensive modules** covering theory, system design, and hands-on implementation.

Our recommendation for each module:
1. Read the article
2. Run the Notebook to replicate our results (locally or on Colab)
3. Following the Notebook, go deeper into the code by reading the `recsys` Python module

> [!NOTE]
> Check the [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](https://github.com/decodingml/hands-on-personalized-recommender/blob/main/INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) doc for a step-by-step installation and usage guide.
